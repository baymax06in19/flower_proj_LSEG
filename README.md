Flower Exchange System (flower_proj_LSEG)
Flower Exchange Story
The Flower Exchange System is a basic trading platform designed to facilitate the buying and selling of flowers. This system comprises two main components:

Trader Application: Traders utilize the Trader Application to submit buy or sell orders for various types of flowers. This application acts as the interface for traders to interact with the exchange.

Exchange Application: The Exchange Application serves as the core of the system. It processes incoming orders, matches them against existing orders in the Order Book, and executes orders, either fully or partially. After processing each order, the Exchange Application generates an Execution Report, which indicates the status of the order. In some cases, orders may be rejected due to factors like quantity limitations or invalid flower types.
